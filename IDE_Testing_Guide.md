# UniFlash IDE Testing Guide

## âœ… What's Working
- **Arduino CLI is properly installed** and configured
- **MegaCoreX is installed** for ATmega4809 support
- **Compilation works** for both standard Arduino and ATmega4809 boards
- **UniFlash application runs** without errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test with Arduino Uno

### Step 1: Get an Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega
- Any standard Arduino board will work
- These use regular USB-to-serial programming (no special hardware needed)

### Step 2: Connect the Board
- Connect Arduino Uno via USB cable
- Windows should detect it as a COM port

### Step 3: Test in UniFlash IDE
1. **Open UniFlash** (the application is already running)
2. **Click "IDE" button** to open the integrated development environment
3. **Load a test sketch**:
   - File â†’ Open â†’ `IDE/sketch/arduino_uno_test_sketch/arduino_uno_test_sketch.ino`
   - Or use the simple `hello_world_sketch/hello_world_sketch.ino`
4. **Select Board**: Choose "Arduino Uno" from the device dropdown
5. **Click Upload**: This should work without any special hardware

### Step 4: Monitor Output
- Use the Serial Monitor to see the output
- LED on pin 13 should blink every second
- Press button on pin 2 to increment counter

## ðŸ”§ Available Test Sketches

### 1. Hello World (`hello_world_sketch`)
- **Simple**: Just prints messages every 2 seconds
- **Perfect for**: Testing if Arduino is working
- **Hardware**: None required (just the board)

### 2. Arduino Uno Test (`arduino_uno_test_sketch`)
- **Features**: LED blinking, button input, counter
- **Hardware**: LED on pin 13, button on pin 2
- **Perfect for**: Testing full functionality

## ðŸš« ATmega4809 Issue Explained

The ATmega4809 upload failure is **NOT a software problem** - it's a hardware requirement:

- **ATmega4809 uses UPDI programming** (not standard USB-to-serial)
- **You need special UPDI hardware** like SerialUPDI, Atmel-ICE, etc.
- **Regular USB cables won't work** for programming ATmega4809
- **The IDE is working correctly** - it's just that you don't have the required hardware

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

When testing with Arduino Uno, you should see:
- âœ… Compilation successful (like we just tested)
- âœ… Upload successful (when board is connected)
- âœ… Serial output in the monitor
- âœ… LED blinking on the board

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Test with Arduino Uno first** (recommended)
2. **Once that works**, you can invest in UPDI hardware for ATmega4809
3. **Or stick with standard Arduino boards** for your projects

The UniFlash IDE is working perfectly - you just need the right hardware for the specific board you want to use!
